**Simple configurations**

At first, you need install the following things:

[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=linux)

[Selenium web driver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)

[Chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

[Java11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)

I'm using [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/) dependencies & Gherkin with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/) for steps definition and test cases as well
